# M4A2-Sherman-Tank
A full CAD model of a M4A2 Sherman Tank created in Solidworks for a first year Engineering design course.  Files included are only the sections that are my own work. I would like to acknowledge the work that my other team members did that is also showcased in our video walk through.
